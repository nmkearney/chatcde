"""What a tool call runs against: the config, the catalogue and the endpoint.

The tool signatures in :mod:`chatcde.tools.core` are the shared contract and are
what the agent sees, so they carry only the arguments an LLM should choose
(query, filters, IDs). Everything else (which config, which catalogue file,
which endpoint client) comes from the *active* :class:`ToolContext`:

* The CLI and the agent open one with :func:`use_context` around their calls.
* Without one, the first tool call builds a default context from
  :func:`chatcde.config.load_config` (handy in a Python shell or notebook).

Each call opens the catalogue read-only and closes it again, so the tools never
block a pipeline stage that writes, and they are safe to call from threads.
The endpoint client is created on first use and shared.
