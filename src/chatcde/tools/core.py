"""Phase 1 tool signatures (DRAFT, to be agreed on day 1).

These are the seven tools the prototype needs. Each is implemented in its own
module and called here with the active
:class:`~chatcde.tools.context.ToolContext` (config, catalogue, endpoint), so the
signatures stay as agreed. Tools not built yet raise ``NotImplementedError``.

Rules for every tool (see CLAUDE.md):

* Plain, typed Python function; no CLI or LLM code inside.
* The docstring is shown to the LLM as the tool description, so it must say
  plainly what the tool does, what each argument means and what it returns.
* Return pydantic models from :mod:`chatcde.schemas`, never free text.
* Counts include their denominators; results carry BORIS IDs for citation.

    By default (``level="group"``) method, data_type, setting, system and

    additional_sub_area by impact area: a record counts once per group, so the
    counts are large enough to compare. Use ``level="term"`` for single terms,
    e.g. when the question names one method. Other dimensions are always
    counted by term; ``row_level`` and ``col_level`` in the result say which
    level was used.

    Counts records, not tags: a record with two methods counts under both.
    Only tags with confidence at least ``filters.min_confidence`` count (unset:
    the configured default, explicit and inferred tags). With
    two dimensions, cells and totals count only records tagged on both;

        row: Dimension for the rows, e.g. ``sub_area``.
        col: Optional dimension for the columns, e.g. ``method``.

    A cell is a gap when its count is at most ``max_ratio`` times the count
    expected if the two dimensions were independent: ``expected = row total x
    column total / records tagged on both``. Cells expected to hold fewer than
    5 records (``gaps.min_expected``) are not judged. Conference items are left
    out unless ``filters.pub_types`` names the types to use. Before calling a
    gap real, check ``coverage_report`` for the same filters and read a few
    records with ``search_publications``.

    To compare one area with the rest of CDE, make its dimension the ``row``
    and do not filter by it (e.g. ``row="impact_area"`` and read the SG cells):
    a filter on the area leaves nothing to compare it with. An empty list means
    no cell is at or below ``max_ratio``.
