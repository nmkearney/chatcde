# Vocabulary changelog

Changes to `draft_vocabulary.yaml`, newest first. Each entry gives the version, the date,
what changed and why. Version numbers follow `version:` in the YAML and `vocab.version`
in `config/default.yaml`.

## 0.4, dimension renamed (2026-11-14)

- **output_type → audience_type** (#60, decision 0040): only the top-level key changes;
  the four audiences and the version stay. The note that the publication type comes from
  BORIS stays in the block (`boris_type`). Stored tags are renamed with `chatcde migrate`.

## 0.4 (2026-11-09)

Changes after the hand check of pilot 2 (20 records, 415 tags; decision 0029), decided in
`vocab/curation/v0.4.xlsx`. The changes were proposed by Claude from the curator's notes;
the curator reviews them. Each changed term has a `note` citing the pilot record.

- **scale, justice_lens:** definitions for all 15 terms. `JUS-none-explicit` is now filled
  in by code (`tagging.none_terms`) and no longer offered to the model.
- **research_mode:** labels M1 "Transformative research (co-creating change)", M2
  "Research on transformations (analytical)", M3 "Transformative education (changing
  teaching)", M4 "Research on sustainability education", with sharper definitions.
- **objective:** definitions for O1–O5 (proposed; to check against Strategy 1.4).
- **actors:** `ACT-researchers-and-universities` excludes the authors and their institutes
  (includes lose "centre for development and environment" and "united nations
  environment programme"). `ACT-national-and-local-government` renamed "National and
  regional government". The funder terms apply only when the work is about the funders.
- **data_type:** `DAT-visual-data` is now `DAT-visual-audio-data`, "Visual and audio
  data" (the curator's code; the old code is retired with `replaced_by`). `DAT-field-data`
  limited to social field observation.
- **additional_sub_area:** new `ASA-natural-hazards-and-disaster-risk` (cross-cutting).
  "water security" added to the includes of the water-management terms.
- **Definitions for every term.** The 37 terms that had none (setting 1, data_type 6,
  method 15, system 8, actors 7) now have one. They were drafted by Claude, with
  boundaries to neighbouring terms, for the curator to review.
- **Duplicates merged.** Three pairs had the same definition word for word. In each, the
  candidate term was merged into the older seed term (also used in the test fixtures), and
  its label became an `includes` synonym:
  - `DAT-policy-documents` → `DAT-documents-and-policies`
  - `DAT-agricultural-statistics` → `DAT-secondary-statistics`, whose definition (copied
    from agricultural statistics) now covers all statistics compiled by others
  - `SYS-agriculture-and-food-sector` → `SYS-food-systems-and-agriculture`
- Four codes retired, each with `replaced_by`: the three merged ones and `DAT-visual-data`
  → `DAT-visual-audio-data`. data_type now has 42 terms, system 65.

## 0.3 (2026-11-08)

Curated from the 353 open-extraction candidates in `vocab/candidates.yaml` (decision
0019) in `vocab/curation/v0.3.xlsx` by Norman Kearney, and written by
`chatcde vocab apply` (decision 0026). Issue #14.

- **Codes.** Every term in a curated dimension has a stable code (`MET-case-study`,
  `SET-mountains`, `ASA-food-security`); groups have codes too (`MET-G-…`). `Tag.term`
  stores the code. `vocab/curation/v0.3_codes.csv` maps every v0.2 label to its code.
- **New layout** for the curated dimensions: `groups`, `terms` (with `definition`,
  `includes`, `related`, `source`) and `retired`.
- **New dimension `additional_sub_area`** (decision 0027): 77 topics outside the strategy
  sub-areas, each with an `impact_area` (SL 26, cross_cutting 21, SG 11, JE 9, TE 5,
  outside 5). Most impact areas were drafted by Claude and reviewed by the curator.
  9 theme candidates were merged into sub-areas instead (their labels are now
  `includes` of JE-a, SL-b, SG-a, TE-a and TE-c) or into other terms.

| Dimension | Terms | Added | Merged in | Retired |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| setting | 27 | 20 | 9 | 0 |
| data_type | 44 | 36 | 6 | 0 |
| method | 60 | 28 | 28 | 2 |
| system | 66 | 46 | 11 | 0 |
| actors | 61 | 44 | 21 | 0 |
| scale | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| justice_lens | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| additional_sub_area | 77 | 77 | 9 | 0 |

- **Groups:** every method, system and actor term has a group. Groups for the terms added
  in v0.3 were drafted by Claude and reviewed by the curator. The v0.2 group labels
  regained their "and" (e.g. "Synthesis and theory", code `MET-G-synthesis-and-theory`).
  New groups: `SYS-G-governance-and-institutions`, `ACT-G-public-and-households`, and six
  for data_type (`DAT-G-…`: documents, texts and media; primary social data; statistics and
  databases; geospatial and remote sensing; environmental measurements; no empirical
  data) and five for setting (`SET-G-…`: mountains and highlands; biomes and ecosystems;
  agricultural and rural landscapes; urban settings and institutions; protected and
  governed areas). Only scale and justice_lens stay flat.
- **Setting:** ten candidates that named places or scales (Africa, Mainland Southeast
  Asia, Switzerland, Global, Global scale, Global North and South, Developing countries,
  National and subnational scales, Global economic systems, and the Swiss-context
  candidate) were rejected; country, region and scale cover them.
- **Retired:** `MET-futures-methods` (no replacement; scenario work now goes to
  `MET-scenario-development-and-analysis`) and `MET-impact-evaluation` (merged into
  `MET-impact-and-sustainability-assessment`).
- **Known limits, for v0.4:**
  - data_type, method, system, actors and additional_sub_area are above the 15–40 target
    (additional_sub_area also above 0027's 25–35).
  - 52 terms have no definition, mostly v0.2 seeds (all of scale and justice_lens).
  - Some additional sub-areas overlap a sub-area's scope (e.g. telecoupling and SL-d).
  - data_type near-duplicates: *Documents and policies* / *Policy documents*,
    *Secondary statistics* / *Agricultural statistics*.
- **Fixtures:** `tests/fixtures/tags.jsonl` and `tag_review.csv` remapped from labels to
  codes (`scripts/remap_fixture_tags.py`); additional_sub_area tags added.
- `vocab/candidates.yaml` added: candidate terms from open extraction on a stratified
  sample of 250 records (`chatcde vocab extract`, decision 0019).

## 0.2 (2026-10-27)

- First draft from the CDE Strategy 2025–2028 plus proposed seed lists
  (see `docs/schema_draft.md`).
